## Style Guidelines

To maintain code quality and consistency:

### JavaScript

- Use ES6 features where appropriate
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use semicolons

### Commits

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

## Translation Contributions

We welcome translations to make the bot accessible to more users:

1. Check the `lang` directory to see existing translations
2. To add a new language:
   - Create a new file in the `lang` directory named with the language code (e.g., `de.js` for German)
   - Use the `en.js` file as a template and translate all strings
   - Update the language options in the `setlang.js` command
